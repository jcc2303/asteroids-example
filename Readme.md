# Asteroid Information App

This is a web application that allows users to view information about asteroids. Users can search for asteroids within a specified date range, view detailed information about individual asteroids, and sort the asteroids by name. Additionally, users have the option to add asteroids to their list of favorites and view details of their favorite asteroids.

## Backend Development

As a backend developer, my role is to handle the server-side logic and database management for this application. I will be responsible for implementing the APIs, writing the business logic, and ensuring data integrity.

### Backend Technologies

To develop the backend of this application, I will be using the following technologies:

- Programming Language: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Web Framework: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

I have extensive experience developing backend applications using Node.js and Express.js. These technologies provide a robust and scalable foundation for building server-side logic. MongoDB will be used as the database to store information about the asteroids and user favorites.

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints will be implemented:

- `GET /asteroids`: Retrieves a list of asteroids.
- `GET /asteroids/:id`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific asteroid.
- `GET /asteroids/search`: Retrieves a list of asteroids within a specified date range.
- `POST /favorites`: Add an asteroid to the list of favorites.
- `GET /favorites`: Retrieves a list of favorite asteroids.
- `GET /favorites/:id`: Retrieves detailed information about a favorite asteroid.

### Business Logic

The backend will implement the following business logic:

- Fetch asteroid data from the NASA API and store it in the database.
- Implement search functionality by querying the database for asteroids within a specified date range.
- Implement sorting functionality by sorting the retrieved asteroid data by name.
- Allow users to add asteroids to their list of favorites.
- Retrieve and display favorite asteroid information.

### Data Integrity

To ensure data integrity, the following measures will be implemented:

- Validation of request parameters to prevent invalid queries or unauthorized access.
- Data sanitization and normalization to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Implementation of authentication and authorization to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints.

## Frontend Development

The frontend development of this application will be handled by another team member. However, as a backend developer, I will collaborate closely with the frontend team to ensure smooth integration between the frontend and backend components.

The frontend will be developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend will consume the backend APIs to retrieve and display asteroid information. The frontend will also handle user interactions such as searching, sorting, and adding favorites.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this web application will provide users with a seamless experience to explore and learn about asteroids. By leveraging the backend technologies and implementing robust APIs and business logic, we will deliver a reliable and high-performance application. The collaboration between the backend and frontend teams will ensure a cohesive and user-friendly interface.
