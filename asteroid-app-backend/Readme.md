To use the implemented backend server and fetch the asteroid data from the NASA API, you can follow 
the steps below:

1. Clone the repository containing the backend server code or create a new directory for the project.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the backend project.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the backend server by running the following command:

```sh
npm start
# that runs node server.js
```

This will start the server and it will be listening on `http://localhost:8000`.

5. Open a web browser or use a tool like Postman to make a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/asteroids?start_date=2015-09-07&end_date=2015-09-08
```

Make sure to replace the `start_date` and `end_date` values with the desired date range. This request
 will fetch the asteroid data from the NASA API for the specified date range.

6. The response will contain the asteroid data in JSON format.

You can use this fetched data in your frontend application to display the list of asteroids, search 
by a range of dates, sort the asteroids by name, and perform any additional required operations.

Make sure to handle any potential errors or edge cases in your frontend code, such as error responses
 from the backend server or incorrect date range inputs.

By following these steps, you will be able to fetch the asteroid data from the NASA API using the 
implemented backend server.
